# Amazon-like E-commerce Backend

This project is a backend implementation of an e-commerce platform similar to Amazon, designed using microservices architecture. It consists of 15 microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the platform. This approach allows for scalable and maintainable code, enabling independent development and deployment of services.

## Microservices Overview

1. **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Product Service**: Manages product listings, details, and updates.
3. **Order Service**: Processes and tracks customer orders.
4. **Inventory Service**: Manages inventory levels and stock availability.
5. **Payment Service**: Facilitates payment processing and transaction management.
6. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users (e.g., order updates, promotions).
7. **Cart Service**: Manages user shopping carts and related operations.
8. **Review and Rating Service**: Allows users to leave reviews and ratings for products.
9. **Recommendation Service**: Provides personalized product recommendations based on user behavior.
10. **Search Service**: Enables product search functionality with various filters.
11. **Analytics Service**: Gathers and analyzes data for insights and reporting.
12. **Discount and Promotion Service**: Manages discount codes and promotional offers.
13. **Shipping Service**: Handles shipping options, tracking, and logistics.
14. **Content Management Service (CMS)**: Manages website content, including pages and blog posts.
15. **Admin Service**: Provides administrative functionalities for managing the platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version)
- MongoDB (or your chosen database)
- Docker (for containerization, if applicable)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramymedhat25/Amazon-Backend
   ```
2. Navigate into each microservice directory and install dependencies:

```bash
  cd user-service
  npm install
```
3. Repeat for each microservice.

### Configuration

- Create a `.env` file in each service's directory with the necessary environment variables. Use the provided `.env.example` as a reference.
- Ensure that your database is running and accessible.

### Running the Services

You can run each microservice individually:

```bash
cd user-service
npm start
```
-Or use Docker to run all services at once (if applicable):
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### API Documentation
